# Lets Go â€” Portfolio Overview

I co-founded and built the product for a two-person startup for ~3 years. I owned the software side end-to-end while my partner ran the business (operations, sales, customer development). This page highlights the architecture and links to the key repositories.

## What the app is
A mobile app for meeting people to **do activities together**. Think swipeable match cards, but focused on **shared activities**, **timeframes**, and **lightweight privacy** (built-in chat so you can coordinate without sharing personal info). The system also supports **Events**â€”sponsored or community activities that appear as their own cards and drop you into a related chat room if you opt in.

## How it works (user view)
1. **Pick activities & a timeframe** (e.g., Pick-up Basketball this weekend, Sushi tonight, Hiking next week).  
2. **Set preferences** (distance, categories, availability).  
3. **Get match cards** generated by a server-side matching engine (activity/category overlap, time windows, recency/inactivity rules).  
4. **Swipe Yes/No** on each card; on a Yes, a **chat room** is available so you can coordinate without exchanging personal details.  
5. **Discover Events** presented as cards; a Yes opens the **event chat** and shows the relevant info.

## Activities & categories (samples)
- **Pick-Up Sports:** Basketball, Soccer, Volleyball  
- **Working Out:** Running, Yoga, Weight Training  
- **Food:** Brunch, Sushi, Mexican  
- **Adventures:** Hiking, Boating, Skiing  
- **Social Drinking & Tastings (21+):** Beer, Wine  
- **Board & Card Games:** Chess, Catan, Magic: The Gathering  
- **Movies/TV & Concerts:** Comedy, Rock, EDM  
- **DIY & Personal Development:** Home Care, Investing & Finances  
- **Video Games:** FPS, Racing, MMORPG

## Highlights (skim me)
- **My role:** system design, backend (C++), Android (Kotlin), matching engine, integrations, server administration, deployment docs.
- **Architecture:** stateless C++ **Application Server** (gRPC/Protobuf) with **MongoDB**.
- **Matching:** Mongo **aggregation pipeline** + **C++ converter** for embedded execution and speed.
- **Clients:** Android app for end users and a **Desktop Admin Interface (Qt)** for moderation/ops and event tools.
- **Integrations:** SMS + Email providers for notifications and verification as well as account flows.

## Highlighted Repositories
- **Server (C++)** â€” stateless hub, gRPC/Protobuf, MongoDB  
  ðŸ‘‰ [`Lets_Go_Server`](https://github.com/lets-go-app-pub/Lets_Go_Server)

- **Android Client (Kotlin)** â€” auth, profiles, activities, chat *(SDK versions may be dated)*  
  ðŸ‘‰ [`Lets_Go_Android_Client`](https://github.com/lets-go-app-pub/Lets_Go_Android_Client)

- **Desktop Admin (Qt)** â€” admin/ops console for moderation, events, stats, and controls  
  ðŸ‘‰ [`Lets_Go_Interface`](https://github.com/lets-go-app-pub/Lets_Go_Interface)

- **Matching (Algo & Converter)** â€” Mongo aggregation (JS) + C++ converter to embed pipelines  
  ðŸ‘‰ [`Lets_Go_Algorithm_And_Conversion`](https://github.com/lets-go-app-pub/Lets_Go_Algorithm_And_Conversion)

- **Protobuf Files** â€” protobuf files used to communicate between server and clients  
  ðŸ‘‰ [`Lets_Go_Protobuf`](https://github.com/lets-go-app-pub/Lets_Go_Protobuf)

- **Docs & Deployment Notes** â€” release checklists, SSL testing, Mongo RS commands  
  ðŸ‘‰ [`Lets_Go_Docs`](https://github.com/lets-go-app-pub/Lets_Go_Docs)

## What I did
- **Architecture & backend:** designed the system, authored most server code, defined gRPC/Proto contracts.
- **Data & matching:** wrote aggregation pipelines and the C++ converter to run them efficiently server-side.
- **Android:** implemented core UI/flows (auth, profiles, activities, chat).
- **Admin interface:** contributed features and workflows used for moderation and operations.
- **Server administration:** provisioned Linux hosts, configured system services, SSL/TLS, backups, and monitoring; operated a MongoDB **replica set** across separate nodes.
- **Integrations:** wired SMS and Email providers for notifications and account flows.

## Status & scope
- Active development ~3 years.
- The company is **sunset**, and this code is provided for anyone that it may have value to as well as for **portfolio** purposes.
- Tooling notes: Android project targets older SDKs; the **Desktop Admin uses Qt** (modern builds may require current Qt tooling/licensing).
